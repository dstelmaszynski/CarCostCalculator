**An application that summarizes the cost of buying and then using a car. The map saves the input data as parameters in the order of:**
 - car cost
 - mileage per year
 - gas consume per 100 km
 - gas cost
 - 100 km driving cost
 - cost per 1 year
   
The application also presents a summary result, which is the sum of: the cost of purchasing the car + the cost of annual use. Example of input data:
- **How many cars do you want to compare?** --> only integers are allowed
- Example input: 2
- **Please enter car brand!** --> only letters are allowed
- Example input: Kia
- **Please enter car brand!** --> only letters are allowed
- Example input: Opel
- **How much car: Kia cost?** --> only integers are allowed
- Example input: 70000
- **How much car: Opel cost?**
- Example input: 85000
- **How many miles per year?** --> only integers are allowed
- Example input: 15000
- **How much gas per 100 km, car: Kia?** --> only deciaml numbers are allowed
- Example input: 6,5
- **How much gas per 100 km, car: Opel?**
- Example input: 8,2
- **How much cost petrol now?** --> only deciaml numbers are allowed
- Example input: 6,30

Note*
Introducing the number of cars to compare will change the behavior of the application. For example, for 2 cars there will be 2 questions about brands. If the number of cars is higher, the number of brands, purchase cost, etc. will also increase.
